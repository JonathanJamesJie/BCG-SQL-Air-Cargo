As the dataset was relatively small, I did checks in excel instead of SQL. I checked for the following.

1. Duplicate data
2. Missing data
3. Errors in data

While there was no 1. and 2. There were mulitple errors I cleaned for 3.

1. Incorrect spellings 1 Count of British Airways and 9 counts of Bristish Airways. Amended to all be British. Brand field in ticket_details
2. Business spelled as Bussiness in Class_id field in ticket_details. Amended spelling to business
