13.	Write a query to create a stored procedure that groups the distance traveled by each flight into three categories. The categories are, short distance travel (SDT) for >=0 AND <= 2000 miles, intermediate distance travel (IDT) for >2000 AND <=6500, and long-distance travel (LDT) for >6500.

ANSWER  : This query returns all routes with a flight category classification based on distance_miles in the CASE statement

CODE:
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE distance ()

BEGIN
SELECT * ,
CASE 
WHEN distance_miles <= 2000 THEN 'short distance travel (SDT)'
WHEN distance_miles > 6500 THEN 'long-distance travel (LDT)'
ELSE 'intermediate distance travel (IDT)'
END AS flight_category
FROM routes;
END $$;

DELIMITER ;

CALL distance ()
