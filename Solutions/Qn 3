3.	Write a query to display all the passengers (customers) who have traveled in routes 01 to 25. Take data from the passengers_on_flights table.

ANS: I am using more identifying fields from the customers table. The where clause should exclude customers who are NOT traveling in routes 01 to 25. 
An inner join is used instead of LEFT join to only include customers appearing on both customer and ticket_details tables who meet the criteria of traveling in routes 01 to 25.
CODE : 

SELECT c.customer_id,
c.first_name,
c.last_name,
p.route_id,
p.travel_date
FROM customer AS c
INNER JOIN passengers_on_flights AS p
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.route_id BETWEEN 01 AND 25;
