6.	Write a query to extract the customers who have registered and booked a ticket. Use data from the customer and ticket_details tables.
ANS: Selected relevant customer info from customer and ticket_details and ensure that p.date is not null so that we can verify there is a booking. Used DISTINCT here as the question asks for customers not all purchases 

CODE: 
SELECT DISTINCT t.customer_id, 
c.first_name, 
c.last_name,
t.no_of_tickets
FROM ticket_details AS t
INNER JOIN customer AS c
ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE p_date IS NOT NULL
AND no_of_tickets IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY t.customer_id ASC
