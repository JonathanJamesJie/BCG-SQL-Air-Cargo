11.	Write a query to create a stored procedure to get the details of all passengers flying between a range of routes defined in run time. Also, return an error message if the table doesn't exist. 

This was the hardest question in the data set as it called for creating procedures and creating error codes when out puts did not exist.

ANSWER 1 â€“ Multiple checks on table existing and to return error if no output exists for the routes called. I did two checks 1 for when there were no passaengers in route

CODE :
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE Flight_route_range3 (IN flight_route_id1 INT, IN flight_route_id2 INT)
BEGIN
    -- Check if passengers_on_flights and customer tables exist
    DECLARE passengers_table_exists INT;
    DECLARE customer_table_exists INT;
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO passengers_table_exists
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = DATABASE() AND table_name = 'passengers_on_flights';

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO customer_table_exists
    FROM information_schema.tables
    WHERE table_schema = DATABASE() AND table_name = 'customer';

    -- If either of the tables does not exist, return an error message
    IF passengers_table_exists = 0 OR customer_table_exists = 0  THEN
        SELECT 'Error: One or more required tables do not exist. ' AS Message;
    ELSE
        -- Check the number of rows that would be returned by the query
        SET @num_rows = (
            SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM passengers_on_flights AS p
            WHERE p.route_id BETWEEN flight_route_id1 AND flight_route_id2
        );

        -- If no rows are returned, raise an error message
        IF @num_rows = 0 THEN
            SELECT 'Error: No data found for the specified flight route range. Table Doesnt Exist' AS Message;
        ELSE
            -- Fetch the passenger and customer details between the specified routes
            SELECT  p.route_id,
                   p.depart,
                   p.arrival,
                   p.seat_num,
                   c.*
            FROM passengers_on_flights AS p
            INNER JOIN customer AS c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
            WHERE p.route_id BETWEEN flight_route_id1 AND flight_route_id2
            ORDER BY p.route_id;
        END IF;
    END IF;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

CALL Flight_route_range3('1','50');

I did two checks 1 for when there were no passaengers in route

1. CALL Flight_route_range3('2','3'); which returned the Error Message No data found for the specified flight route range. Table Doesnt Exist

2. When I dropped the customer table from the dataset and ran the call.
Error Message Error: One or more required tables do not exist
