2.	Write a query to create route_details table using suitable data types for the fields, such as route_id, flight_num, origin_airport, destination_airport, aircraft_id, and distance_miles. Implement the check constraint for the flight number and unique constraint for the route_id fields. Also, make sure that the distance miles field is greater than 0.

ANS: In this case I have made route_id the primary key so the field is Unique and cannot contain Nulls. 
Then I altered the table to add a check constraint for the flight_num > 1 and NOT NULL and distance_miles > 0.
I then did a check on the distance_miles field to find if there were any returns for < 0 of which there were none. 
CODE: 
DESCRIBE routes;

ALTER TABLE routes
MODIFY flight_num int NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE routes
ADD CHECK (flight_num > 1),
ADD CHECK (distance_miles > 0);

-- Check for any errors.
SELECT *
FROM routes
WHERE distance_miles <0;
